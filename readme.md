MVX is an exciting application designed to help you dive into the world of movies, TV shows, and more. In creating this project, I've been on a learning journey, improving my skills in handling frontend APIs while exploring the power of `rtk-query`. The backbone of MVX is the robust `TMDB API`, which provides a wealth of information to enhance your experience.
